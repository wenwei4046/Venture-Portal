Spec Documents (MUST READ BEFORE CODING)
All specifications are in `/docs/`. These are the source of truth:
db-schema.md — 32 tables, all fields, relationships, constraints
access-matrix.md — 4 roles × 9 modules, RLS patterns, data visibility
module-spec-phase1.md — Dashboard, Fund IN, Fund OUT, Overdue & Netting
module-spec-phase2.md — Dept Pool, Service Billing (5 modes)
module-spec-phase3.md — Director Salary Engine, HR Costing, Reports
module-spec-revenue-commission.md — Revenue Department commission payroll: the
  second payroll TYPE (ERP sales orders → commission engine → the one
  `hr_monthly_payroll.commission_amount` field). Sub-departments, the tier
  ladder, deposit gate, brand margin bands, Withholding Tax. Read this before
  touching anything under `comm_*` / `sales_*` or `/revenue`. §3.0 explains the
  routing: every page is scoped to a sub-department (`/revenue/fair/rules`) and
  the sidebar's Revenue children are database rows, not constants.
DESIGN.md — v3.0 Ledger-Dense design system. **Single source of truth for all UI.** Colors, typography, components, page anatomy, the v3.0 utility classes (`.num`, `.ledger-table`, `.page-head`, etc), and canonical reference pages.
ALWAYS reference these docs before implementing any feature.

Other project docs (at repo root):
TODOS.md — Phase 1.5 tech debt, Phase 2/3 prerequisites, compliance gates

4 Roles
Role	DB Value	Access
Principal	`principal`	Everything + Approve + Settings
Finance	`finance`	Treasury + Billing + Reports — no individual salary, no Director Salary module, no Director Pool (v2 2026-07-21: calculator is Principal + HR only)
HR	`hr`	Staff costs + Director Salary + Claims + Director Pool (v2 calculator, granted 2026-07-21) + Revenue Department (commission rules, hierarchy, runs — but NOT the Product List, which is Principal-only)
Dept Manager	`dept_manager`	Own department only
Key Business Rules
Treasury
Subsidiaries deposit savings in HV at negotiated rates (per-deal, not fixed)
HV lends to subsidiaries at Base Rate + per-loan custom premium (set at creation, locked for the loan's life). Tier system was removed mig 63 — no T1/T2/T3 labels anywhere.
Base Rate = Weighted Avg Cost of Paid Capital + Op Margin (quarterly, Principal approves)
Loan rate locked at creation, never changes
Free pool priority when lending (tracked via Dashboard, not separate allocation)
Director Salary (Most Complex Module)
7 subs pay CTC (basic + KPI with statutory, allowance without) → total = HV revenue
Pool ÷ 4 × weightage → per director gross
5% saving deducted on non-statutory portion
75/25 split: payroll vs invoice to outsource
75% payroll: min RM14,400 gross → deduct EPF ER + EE, SOCSO ER + EE, EIS ER + EE, PCB → net to director
25% invoice: base + employer statutory → accumulate in isolated pool
PCB: lookup Jadual PCB table (not calculated)
All statutory: table lookup, NOT flat percentages
Monthly Consolidated Statement
Invoice items (billable) + Contra items (loan repayment, savings interest)
Loan repayment is NOT invoiced, only listed as contra
Net amount = Invoice total - Contra total
One statement per subsidiary per month
Data Visibility
Finance CANNOT see individual employee salaries — only department lump sum
Finance CANNOT access the Director Salary module or Director Pool at all. (Director Pool v2 2026-07-21: the old aggregate-bucket view Finance used was replaced by the standalone calculator — Principal + HR only.)
HR CAN access Director Pool v2 (standalone calculator — full per-director detail; granted by user 2026-07-21)
Only HR and Principal can see individual salary details
Development Phases

Dashboard (dashboard_summary RPC), Fund IN, Fund OUT, Overdue & Netting,
Monthly Statements, Approvals (Finance→Principal workflow), Settings, Auth
9-step Forge pipeline (see Phase 1 commits a04a7bf..9a5e663)

Invoice Generation RPC, Invoice→Statement wiring, Rent/Utility templates,
Unified config audit log (L2 fix), Dashboard KPI extensions (billing float,
dept pool total, Marketing NP). M2 cancelLoan fix bundled in Step 2.
9-step Forge pipeline (commits e58a8bb..Step 9). See
`.gstack/qa-reports/qa-report-phase2-2026-04-10.md`.
Phase 3: Salary + HR + Reports
Director Salary Engine, HR Costing, Claims, Reports, Statutory Tables
GStack Workflow
For each phase:
```
1. /plan-eng-review    → Review spec, find edge cases, output diagrams
2. /design-consultation → Design system, component patterns
3. Parallel development → Backend API + Frontend UI (git worktree)
4. /ship               → Test, coverage, PR
5. /qa                 → Edge cases, security, RLS audit
6. /land-and-deploy    → Deploy to Vercel
7. /document-release   → Update docs
8. /retro              → Phase review
```
Coding Conventions
TypeScript strict mode — no `any`
Server Components by default — Client Components only when needed (forms, interactive widgets)
Writes — use Server Actions (`'use server'`), NOT API Route Handlers. Every action calls `requireRole(...)` at entry.
Read-only file downloads (PDF, CSV, ZIP binary streams) — GET Route Handlers (`app/**/route.ts`) are OK because Server Actions can't stream binary responses cleanly. Still call `requireRole(...)` at entry. Never accept write-side params — POST/PUT/DELETE route handlers remain forbidden. Locked by user 2026-04-17 (Spec 5 blocker Q5).
Supabase client — server-side (`lib/supabase/server.ts`) uses anon key with RLS via SSR cookies. Service role client (`admin.ts`) is dormant + `'server-only'` guarded; avoid unless you truly need to bypass RLS.
Aggregate queries — prefer RPC functions (`dashboard_summary`, `get_hr_cost_summary`) over scattered per-field selects. Single round-trip, clearer intent, easier to unit test at SQL level.
Error handling — Server Actions throw, pages use error boundaries, never return `{ data, error }` to the client
Date handling — store as `date` or `timestamptz` in DB, use `dayjs` for formatting. Compare by day (`dayjs().isAfter(x, 'day')`) to avoid timezone edge cases.
Money — `decimal(15,2)` in DB. Display with `formatMoney()` from `lib/utils.ts`. Negative amounts render as red parenthesis notation `(1,000.00)`.
Naming — DB: snake_case, TypeScript: camelCase, Components: PascalCase
Files — one component per file, co-locate related files (`_components/` subfolders per route)
Testing
Framework: Vitest + happy-dom + @testing-library/react (bootstrapped Phase 1.5 Step 1). Run `npm test` (watch) or `npm run test:ci` (single run). CI runs tests + `next build` on every push (`.github/workflows/test.yml`).
Layers: unit (pure helpers in `src/lib/*.test.ts`), integration (Supabase RPC — deferred until billing math in Phase 2 Step 5 needs it), RLS audit (manual via `/qa`), E2E (Playwright MCP during per-step verification, not in CI).
Convention: every bug fix ships with a regression test. Extract pure logic from Server Actions into `src/lib/*.ts` helpers and test the helper (Server Actions themselves pull in next/cache + next/navigation + Supabase SSR cookies, mocking is more trouble than it's worth).
Placeholder pattern: when a fix is planned but not yet implemented, drop a `describe.todo('...')` stub at the expected test file location so it stays indexed without breaking CI.
API routes: test with sample data matching real scenarios
Statutory lookups: test with known values from PDF tables
Director salary: test with the two datasets provided in specs (verify against calculated results)
RLS: test each role can only access what Access Matrix allows — see `docs/access-matrix.md`
See `TESTING.md` at repo root for full layer descriptions + how to add new tests.
Do NOT
Do not hardcode any rates (interest, custom premium, penalty, saving %) — all from Settings/DB
Do not skip RLS — every table must have policies matching Access Matrix
Do not let Finance access hr_staff_costs or director_payouts detail — use aggregate views
Do not use localStorage for auth — use Supabase Auth sessions
Do not create separate apps — single Next.js app, role-based routing
Do not invent parallel design docs (no `DESIGN-v2.md`, `STYLE.md`, `UI-NOTES.md`, etc) — DESIGN.md is the single source of truth, extend it in place
Do not hardcode hex colors in components — use Tailwind tokens (`text-ink`, `bg-paper`, `text-num-ink`, `border-hairline`, `text-accent`, `text-danger`) backed by CSS vars in `globals.css`
Do not use the superpowers plugin (brainstorming/TDD/writing-plans skills, `docs/superpowers/` plan+spec files) unless really needed — default to working directly; reserve it for genuinely complex multi-step features where the planning overhead pays off

UI Conventions (v3.0 — enforced)
**Read `docs/DESIGN.md` first before adding or amending any UI.** It contains the v3.0 implementation rules + utility class catalog + canonical reference pages.

Five non-negotiable rules every new/amended page must follow:
1. **Page header** — wrap top of page in `<div className="page-head">` containing `<div className="page-eyebrow"><em>I.</em> SECTION · NAME</div>` + `<h1 className="page-title">…</h1>`. Right side may hold an action button.
2. **Money cells use `.num`** — `<td className="num">{formatMoney(x)}</td>`. Negatives get `<span className="neg">`. Hero figures use `text-num-ink` + `tabular` + `tracking-[-0.01em]`.
3. **Data tables use `.ledger-table`** — `<table className="ledger-table">` with bare `<th>` / `<td>`. Class wires up surface bg, zebra rows, hover, hairline borders, padding, and right-aligned `.num`. Stop hand-rolling `<table className="w-full text-sm">…border-b…hover:bg-…`.
4. **Section headings use `.sect-head`** — italic serif title + hairline rule extending right + uppercase mono counter. See `src/app/(portal)/statements/page.tsx` for the canonical pattern.
5. **Colors via CSS variables only** — no hex outside `globals.css`. Use `text-ink` / `text-num-ink` / `text-graphite` / `bg-paper` / `bg-surface` / `border-hairline` / `text-accent` / `text-danger` / `text-ledger` / `text-alert` / `text-info`.

Canonical reference pages (copy these patterns when in doubt):
- Page header + hero number + ledger table → `src/app/(portal)/fund-out/page.tsx`
- Multi-column hero summary → `src/app/(portal)/payments/page.tsx`
- Section-grouped tables → `src/app/(portal)/statements/page.tsx`, `src/app/(portal)/overdue/page.tsx`
- Sidebar (roman numerals + dot/bar markers) → `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
