-- A late key-in whose month is paid or closed lands in a month still open (2026-10-12)
-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
--
-- WHY. Since 20261006140000 a NEW ERP document lands in its sale day's month
-- (the fair day the salesperson picked). A late key-in — sold at a fair, keyed
-- into the ERP after that month's commission was applied, or for a month closed
-- to the feed (by hand, or June–August, before the cutover) — was then HELD:
-- in no month's table, not in the Revenue app or the Arena, paid to nobody, a
-- line in the feed's log nobody reads. The user, 2026-10-12, of late key-ins:
-- "will go in the table as well … but commission, it will jump to the same
-- month, then show up with different colour. if hr know this order is non
-- calculation with comm, they will right click" — and, shown the choice, "can
-- go for b".
--
-- THE RULE: such a document lands in the first month still open from the month
-- it was keyed in (its order date's month; never its sale month or earlier,
-- never past the office's own month) — normally the month it was keyed in.
-- Comm Cal marks it Late key-in · Sep 2026 fair with the other-month wash
-- (lib/commission/row-origin.ts) and pays it with that month, at that month's
-- rate, in that month's sales. A bill already paid by hand on a claim form is
-- flagged by Double claims (Would pay twice) and taken out with Don't count.
-- No month open: held, as before. Only NEW documents: a bill already in the
-- portal keeps its month on every re-send (a bill with a fair keeps its month),
-- and a re-send into a paid month is still held as a drop or an upsell.
--
-- ingest_erp_sales_order is production's body (md5 617633ebf7fe8dfa0f784ec21dcf7138,
-- the same as 20261006140000's) with three swaps: three variables, the block
-- before "Locks", and the log line's tail. Nothing else in it changes.
--
-- Rollback: re-apply 20261006140000's ingest_erp_sales_order.
