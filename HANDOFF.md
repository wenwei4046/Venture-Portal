# HOUZS Venture Portal — Session Handoff (checkpoint 2026-06-03)

> Context-window handoff. Read this first to continue. User communicates in 华语 (Mandarin).
> Supersedes the 2026-05-28 checkpoint. Latest session shipped consolidated invoice
> settlement + single-settle payment date + batch-entry discoverability (see next section).
> Earlier 2026-05-28 work (GL re-import + dept-pool restructure + billing UX) is still current below.

## Latest session (2026-06-03): Consolidated invoice settlement

Followed the superpowers brainstorm → spec → plan → subagent-driven build flow.
- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-consolidated-invoice-settlement-design.md`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-03-consolidated-invoice-settlement.md`
- Deployed to main (commits `0301b3f`..`a6db977`); live + tests (234) + build green.

Three user-facing changes:
1. **Consolidated settle (true one-voucher).** Selecting issued invoices of the SAME
   company → ONE Official Receipt voucher (amount = sum), all invoices marked paid.
   New action `settleInvoicesConsolidated` in `billing/actions.ts` **replaced** the old
   `batchSettleInvoices` (which minted N vouchers). Cross-company selections are
   **blocked** (one receipt = one payer) at both client + server. dept_pool
   (inter-billing) invoices still excluded — settle individually.
2. **Single-settle payment date.** `NewPaymentForm` now has a `payment_date` field
   (default = browser-local today, backdate-able). `createPaymentVoucher` threads it
   into the voucher `payment_date` AND the settlement JE `transactionDate` (was
   hardcoded `todayStr`). Only persists on the credit/auto-complete (settle) path.
3. **Discoverable entry.** `/statements` Invoices tab (`InvoicesList`) now has a
   prominent 「全选可结算发票」button + floating 「合并结算 N 张 → 生成收据」 bar.

Data model: **mig 276** adds `invoices.settlement_voucher_id` (nullable FK →
payment_vouchers, ON DELETE SET NULL). Reverse pointer = the 1:N link (one voucher
settles many invoices). Consolidated voucher has `invoice_id = NULL`; invoices point
back via `settlement_voucher_id`. Legacy `payment_vouchers.invoice_id` (single) is
untouched — single-settle still writes it. `settlement_voucher_id` is currently
**write-only** (no reader yet — verified no read path breaks on invoice_id=NULL:
payments detail/list + cfo-reports all read via voucher_id / PVS / payee_name).

New pure helper `src/lib/invoice-settlement.ts` (`payeeKey`, `validateConsolidation`)
shared by client + server so the same-payer check can't drift. Tested (10 tests).

⚠️ Known follow-up (spawned as a task, not yet done): `settleInvoicesConsolidated`
is non-transactional (Supabase JS limit). If the final invoice-status update fails
after the money-side writes, you get an orphaned voucher and a re-run mints a 2nd
voucher (invoices still 'issued'). Same convention as `createPaymentVoucher`. Add an
idempotency / orphan guard when convenient.

## Project
- HV internal banking portal. Next.js 15 (App Router) + Supabase + Vercel + TypeScript + Tailwind.
- Local: `C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\Claude\Venture\Venture-Portal`
- Supabase project ref: `gixpptmfuryskbwkmiwz` (use the `supabase` MCP tools)
- GitHub: `wenwei4046/Venture-Portal`
- Read `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/DESIGN.md` before touching code.

## ⚠️ Vercel deployment
- Live site: **venture-portal-chi.vercel.app** under `wenwei4046s-projects`. Auto-deploys on `git push origin main`. Do NOT use `vercel --prod` (chi rejects with permission denied).
- Last pushed commit at checkpoint: `7d28828` (batch settle invoices).
- ⚠️ OneDrive sync locks `.next/` on Windows occasionally — if dev server EBUSY-loops, stop + `rm -rf .next` + restart.

## ⚠️ DB write methods
- `supabase` MCP tools are connected; use `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` for DML and `apply_migration` for DDL/RPC changes.
- For DML where MCP isn't available, run a node script that loads `.env.local` → `@supabase/supabase-js` with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Pattern: `scripts/gl-import-apply-v2.mjs`.
- TypeScript types: regen via `mcp__supabase__generate_typescript_types`, unwrap JSON (`JSON.parse(text).types`), write to `src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts`.

## Major changes this session (2026-05-26 → 28)

### A. GL re-import (new source: 26-May-2026 XLSX)
- Source: `C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\Houzs Venture - General Ledger 26.05.2026.xlsx` (53 source accounts, 1,613 raw lines).
- TB: `C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\Trial Balance.pdf` (Dr=Cr=**1,676,933.38**).
- 334 manual_jv entries / 1,580 journal_lines now in DB (wipe + re-insert via `scripts/gl-import-apply-v2.mjs`).
- Adjusting JEs baked in by `scripts/gl-import-preview-v2.mjs`:
  1. **Year-end closing 2025-12-31**: Dr 1510 RE 2,024 / Cr 9000 GE 2,024 (segment='corporate')
  2. **Suspense-split 2026-05-20**: 3053 ↔ 3063 + 4052 ↔ 4062 each 38,333.33 (segment='unallocated')
  3. **Per-bank cleanup (2 JEs)**: Alliance reserved for Director-only convention. Cross-segment transfer 19,651.43 from corporate→director via 1900 clearing.
- PV-000077 correction (4,130→3,540) is **already baked into the new source** — preview script's old correction toggle was removed.
- TB reconciliation: every account matches (verified post-import).

### B. Dept Pool re-opening (mig 269 → 270 → 271)
- 5 dept_pool opening rows after 3 iterations (Director value flip-flopped during user clarification):
  - Director: **np_in 37,218.37** (final, mig 271) — includes 19,651.43 top-up from Venture Pool via the cross-segment GL transfer JEs
  - Director Office: expense_out 2,255.49
  - Finance: expense_out 361.80
  - Marketing: expense_out 16,107.10
  - HR: no row (balance 0)
- Per-bank × per-segment landed as intended: **Alliance = Director only (922.47)**, HL absorbs everyone else.
- `/dept-pool` Total cash = 9,928.14 = HL 9,005.67 + Alliance 922.47 ✓ (bank-recon).

### C. Director Pool reset
- `director_payouts` drafts **DELETED** (Saving 9,040.69 → 0).
- `invoice_payout_pool` **wiped + 4 new rows** per user-provided breakdown:
  - WL (`a5f55a13`): 7,910.04
  - MK (`18b3aa79`): 8,790.51
  - WS (`5f9bec22`): 9,770.81
  - WW (`b5add299`): 10,747.01
  - Total: **37,218.37**
- `/director-pool` Total Pool = 37,218.37 (saving 0 + invoice 37,218.37).

### D. Save & Calculate behaviour fix (mig 268)
- `save_director_salary_results` RPC no longer writes `dept_pools` rows. Director Pool cash now lives via the same `credit_dept_pool_on_invoice_paid` trigger (mig 202) as the other 4 depts → driven by billing_payment PV settlement.
- Previously the RPC's `DELETE FROM dept_pools WHERE period_month=... AND transaction_type='np_in'` collaterally wiped bank-recon opening rows.

### E. Venture Pool semantic (corporate + treasury)
- Single segment filter `journal_entries.segment IN ('corporate', 'treasury')` applied in 5 read paths:
  - `/venture-pool` (hero, this-month, 12-month, ledger)
  - `/dept-pool` Venture row + per-bank breakdown
  - `dashboard_summary` RPC (mig 273)
  - `/reports/fund-summary` + xlsx/pdf export
- `treasury` includes future fund_in / fund_out / loan_repayment via `derive_journal_segment` (mig 217). Currently 0 in historical GL but auto-flows future activity.
- The legacy `venture_pool` TABLE is **kept** with existing writers untouched (approval/fund-out/voucher-paid), but **no reads anymore**. User decision: leave alone.

### F. Per-bank × per-segment view
- `/dept-pool` Cash tab has a **"Per-bank breakdown"** section under the main table.
- Rows: 5 depts + Venture (corporate+treasury merged). Cols: HL · Alliance · Total + bottom "Bank balance" row.
- Driven by `journal_lines + journal_entries.segment + account_code ∈ bank_accounts.gl_account_code`.

### G. Per-director Billed / Used / Remaining on `/director-pool`
- New table below Director Invoice section (Principal only).
- "Used" = sum of negative balances on the other 4 dept pools + Office (corporate cash if negative) — pro-rated across directors by their share of total billed.
- Last row absorbs rounding so column sums foot exactly.
- Current: Used 27,290.23, Remaining 9,928.14 (= bank cash).

### H. Billing UX overhaul
- **Multi-line invoice** (new flow, mig 275 + `CreateMultiLineInvoiceButton`): one bill, one bill-to, N line items each with own description / amount / category. Approve & Issue fans out per-line Cr JE. Single-line "+ Create Invoice" path still exists alongside.
- **Edit / Delete draft invoices** (mig 274 — `invoices_finance_delete_draft` policy; soft-field editor modal): finance can fix typos or delete pre-approval. Issued/paid stay locked.
- **Per-invoice PDF + batch PDF** at `/billing/invoice-doc`:
  - `?id=<uuid>` single page
  - `?ids=a,b,c` multi-page
  - `?period=YYYY-MM` whole period
  - PDF template = HV letterhead + bill-to + line items table (or flat desc) + total + reference
  - Per-row PDF link + period-batch button in /statements
- **Batch settle (knock-off)**: checkbox column on InvoicesList. Select any subset of `issued` (non-dept_pool) invoices, floating bar → modal (bank + date) → server creates billing_payment PV per invoice, all auto-paid. `batchSettleInvoices` server action.
- **OPEX cards gating fix**: cards + hero only show payroll figures after `payroll_runs.approved_at IS NOT NULL` (was firing on row exists). Subtitle differentiates: HR not submitted / HR submitted — awaiting Principal approval / Principal approved.
- **Modal scroll fix**: Create Invoice / Multi-line / New account modals use `items-start + backdrop overflow-y-auto + my-4` so they open at top, page scrolls naturally.
- **Sticky headers**: `/statements?tab=invoices` BillingView page-head + `/settings` Chart of Accounts header are `sticky top-0` — Create buttons always reachable.
- **New account button**: was tiny text link, now accent button + modal popup.

### I. Dashboard / reports
- `dashboard_summary` RPC: mig 272 → 273 (Venture Pool from journal_lines, includes corporate + treasury). Pool breakdown shows Venture row alongside dept pools (frontend appends).
- `/reports/ledger` enhancements (2026-05-25 sub-session, already shipped): search, reverse-order toggle, global back-to-top button.

### J. Cleanup
- 17 stale one-off scripts deleted (apply-mig-*, verify-mig-*, diagnose-*, etc.).
- /operating-fund orphan route deleted (duplicate of /venture-pool).
- `.env.local.shared` kept untouched (per user, secrets visible in OneDrive but accepted).

## Current data state (post-session, key facts)

### `/dashboard`
- Pool = **9,928.14** (= 18,493.98 dept_pools + (-8,565.84) Venture)
- Pool breakdown shows 5 dept pool rows + Venture (Office)

### `/dept-pool` Cash tab
- Director **37,218.37** / Director Office **(2,255.49)** / Finance **(361.80)** / HR 0.00 / Marketing **(16,107.10)** / Venture (Office) **(8,565.84)** → Total **9,928.14**
- Per-bank breakdown: Alliance = Director 922.47 only; HL takes the rest.

### `/director-pool`
- Total Pool 37,218.37 (saving 0 + invoice 37,218.37)
- Director Pool balance 37,218.37 → reconciliation "Buckets balance ✓"
- Per-director usage table: Billed 37,218.37 / Used 27,290.23 / Remaining 9,928.14

### `/reports/trial-balance`
- Dr = Cr = **1,676,933.38** (ties TB PDF)

### Bank
- HL (3000): 9,005.67 · Alliance (3010): 922.47 · Total 9,928.14
- `bank_accounts.current_balance` ties GL.

### May 2026 payroll_run
- Exists with HR 18,877.26 / Finance 23,170.12 / Marketing 47,166.26 / etc.
- `approved_at = NULL` (Principal hasn't approved yet) → all OPEX cards and hero show RM 0.00 with "awaiting Principal approval" subtitle. Once Principal approves on `/approvals/payroll-run/<id>`, figures surface.

## Migrations added this session
- `267_add_venture_attribution_billing_mode` — Postgres ENUM gains 'venture_attribution' so the new pool option works.
- `268_save_director_salary_drop_dept_pool_np_in` — Save & Calculate no longer writes dept_pools.
- `269_dept_pools_opening_2026_05_26` — first opening write (Director 37,218.37 in the originally interpreted role).
- `270_dept_pools_director_opening_to_natural_gl` — interim revert (Director 17,566.94) — superseded.
- `271_dept_pools_director_opening_to_37218_37` — final Director 37,218.37 again (current).
- `272_dashboard_venture_pool_from_journal_lines` — RPC reads journal_lines for hv_fund_balance.
- `273_dashboard_venture_pool_include_treasury` — RPC also includes treasury segment.
- `274_invoices_allow_finance_delete_draft` — RLS policy unlocks finance DELETE on draft.
- `275_invoice_lines_table` — new table for multi-line invoices + RLS.
- `276_invoices_settlement_voucher_id` — (2026-06-03 session) nullable FK on invoices → payment_vouchers for consolidated-receipt linkage.
- `277_drop_billing_payment_has_invoice` — (2026-06-03 session) dropped the obsolete CHECK that forced every billing_payment voucher to have a non-null invoice_id. It rejected consolidated OR vouchers (invoice_id=NULL). Root-caused via postgres ERROR log. Single-settle still sets invoice_id at app layer.

> Note: mig 269 / 270 / 271 are sequential reverts during user clarification. Current state = mig 271. Don't try to "clean up" by removing the interim ones — each runs in order; later overrides earlier.

## Scripts (in `scripts/`)
- `gl-import-preview-v2.mjs` — parses 26-May-2026 XLSX, applies YE closing + suspense split + per-bank cleanup, emits `gl-import-entries-v2.json`. Read-only.
- `gl-import-apply-v2.mjs` — wipes manual_jv + bulk-inserts the 334 entries / 1,580 lines, verifies TB + per-bank × per-segment.
- `gl-import-entries-v2.json` — the actual entries that landed in production (committed for traceability).
- (v1 versions `gl-import-preview.mjs` / `gl-import-apply.mjs` / `gl-import-entries.json` are legacy, kept for history but not used.)

## Open / pending decisions

### 1. venture_pool TABLE retirement
- Currently: 4 codepaths still INSERT into venture_pool (approvals/actions.ts L129/249/614, fund-out/actions.ts L220, lib/voucher-paid-helpers.ts L32, billing/BillingView.tsx L65 read).
- All READS have been moved off the table; writes are harmless but pollute on each PV/loan approval.
- User said "leave alone" — revisit only if it causes drift or noise later.

### 2. Multi-line invoice — edit / inter-billing edge cases
- `updateDraftInvoice` only edits flat soft fields. Multi-line edit not yet supported (must delete + recreate).
- Inter-billing (dept_pool target) on multi-line invoices works in create flow but the approve/issue JE path treats it like single-line (per-line Cr to category, no per-line inter-billing mirror). Likely fine for the cases user has but verify before scaling.

### 3. Batch settle — inter-billing excluded
- Batch action rejects `billable_to_type='dept_pool'` invoices. User must settle those individually via `/payments/new?invoice_id=`.
- Could be expanded later by inlining the inter_billing_out + mirror logic; punted for now.

### 4. User mentioned "I have a little bit to change" on session end
- New session will likely bring small tweaks. Listen first, then act — don't pre-emptively start.

## COA additions / mapping
Same as previous handoff (the COA itself is unchanged this session). For new invoices using `billing_mode='venture_attribution'`:
- Falls back to `5000` Cr account if no category_code given; per-line categories now override correctly (mig 275 + `resolveRevenueGlCode` honors any active COA code).

## Key IDs
- Principal user: `cbc6a18a-3f38-4567-b8c3-385d00b9e6b3`; Finance: `6c0c28a2-c936-4c83-9bf8-b8c54bda51c5`
- Director dept: `bb927615-b3cd-466a-9e65-c9a35999cb82`
- Companies: 2990 `8a7c5a36`, CAR `daeeb093`, CMI `538a18d5`, CONTS `89c32d76`, HC `5eab1801`, HK `24204cca`, OHN `346274df`
- Directors: MK `18b3aa79`, WL `a5f55a13`, WS `5f9bec22`, WW `b5add299`

## Source files on Desktop (current truth)
- `Houzs Venture - General Ledger 26.05.2026.xlsx` — latest GL (now imported)
- `Trial Balance.pdf` — final TB at 26 May 2026 (Dr=Cr 1,676,933.38)
- `HV - General Legder 22.05.xlsx` / `HV - Trial Balance 22.05.pdf` — superseded
- `HV - Bank Reconciliation - Format 1.pdf` — informational; bank-recon decision already baked into mig 269/271 + cleanup JEs.

## Reports architecture (unchanged from prior handoff)
- Income Statement / Balance Sheet / Cash Flow built from OPERATIONAL subledgers (payment_vouchers, invoices, treasury) PLUS the `manual_jv` GL entries folded via `gatherManualJvPnl` in `cfo-reports.ts`.
- Trial Balance reads `journal_lines` directly.
- Treasury-managed account codes (interest income / penalty income / interest expense by NAME, type=revenue/other_income/expense respectively) are EXCLUDED from the manual_jv fold and instead summed by `gatherTreasury` → routed to Venture Pool. **Interest expense lands in `vp.cost`** (not `vp.expense`).
- Per-pool layout (Income Statement, Cash Flow, /dept-pool page) share 6-pool view: Venture · Marketing · HR · Finance · Director Office · Director Pool. Empty pools shown.

## Untracked files
- `.env.local.shared` — copy of .env.local with secrets exposed in plain text. User decided to leave it (option C). DO NOT commit.

## Quick gotchas / future-Claude reminders
- When the user gives flip-flopping clarifications about a number, write a layered plan + numbered options BEFORE touching DB — they appreciate "let me confirm interpretation". Three migrations 269→270→271 for Director opening = the cost of skipping that step.
- TS type generation via Supabase MCP returns JSON-wrapped — needs `JSON.parse(text).types` extraction before writing to `database.types.ts`.
- `redirect()` inside server actions breaks if called in loops — extract logic into helpers when batching (see `batchSettleInvoices`).
- Bash CWD resets between calls — `cd /c/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/Claude/Venture/Venture-Portal && <cmd>` for git, node, npx.
- If new helper scripts appear during work (apply-mig-* etc.), decide upfront whether they're disposable (delete on session end) or worth checking in. This session's policy: delete one-offs once the work has been applied.
- Modals: use `items-start` + backdrop `overflow-y-auto` + `my-4` so they open at top — `items-center` + inner `overflow-y-auto` can land mid-content.
- Sticky headers + paper backdrop work fine inside `<main className="overflow-y-auto">` (the PortalFrame scroll container). Use `sticky top-0 z-20 bg-paper`.
- Vercel build is faster than typecheck locally (~60s) — push and watch instead of waiting for local `next build`. Errors surface quickly in the build log.
